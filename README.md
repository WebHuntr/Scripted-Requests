# Scripted-Requests
This repo contains different request types and formats in different languages, the base of each request is from PentesterLab.com and their "HTTP" badge, but I decided to automate these to assist with web application testing in the future.
I hope this can be useful to someone else out there as well :) 

The "Curl" Folder contains all requests in basic curl format, the corresponding language directories contains the same requests in that languages format.

The timeline (hopefully) is as follows:

Curl: 08/31/2024

Bash: 09/01/2024

Python: 09/02/2024

Golang: 12/01/2024

Assembly: 12/01/2025

I don't know any of these languges or how to code in general, so we will see how it actually goes, I will update this list as progress is made.
